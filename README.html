<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The report focuses on the design and implementation of a rescue drone planning system for navigating disaster sites using a grid-based environment. It includes the testing of the planner on various grid configurations and an analysis of the efficiency of the solutions generated, considering factors like search space, operator applicability, and performance across different test cases. The goal is to evaluate whether the planner can consistently generate effective and optimal rescue plans.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-of-the-problem">Analysis of the problem</h2>
<p>For solving the problem we will use as inspiration the two labs that we have done in with the professor:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-Puzzle Game</li>
</ul>
<p>We designed a theoretically feasible approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>We first need to define all the positions on the grid and declare adjancent those we can move between.</li>
<li>We should define types for all the objects and predicates to locate them in the grid. Also for identifying special locations as obstacles and the safe zone.</li>
<li>We should implement actions for the drone for being able to <strong>move</strong>, <strong>pick-up</strong> a person and <strong>drop-off</strong> a person at the safe zone.</li>
<li>We should take into account that the drone can't move to positions that have obstacles.</li>
<li>As we don't need an order we don't need to use an ordered number set for modeling capacity. Instead of this, we will use predicates that represents units (capacities) and we will negate them when used. But we don't mind if one capacity object is used before another as it is only important is to respect the maximum capacity of the safe zone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we proceed with the implementation in pddl.</p>
<h3 id="static-domain-file-overview-rescue-drone-staticdomainpddl">Static Domain File Overview: <code>rescue-drone-static_domain.pddl</code></h3>
<p>This file defines the <strong>static rules</strong> and capabilities of the environment, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>location</code>, <code>person</code>, <code>drone</code>, <code>capacity</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Predicates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>(Drone-location ?d ?loc)</code>: The drone is at a specific location.</li>
<li><code>(Person-location ?p ?loc)</code>: A person is located at a specific location.</li>
<li><code>(Drone-free)</code>: The drone is available to pick up someone.</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Actions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Move</strong>: The drone can move between adjacent locations if there are no obstacles.</li>
<li><strong>Pick-up</strong>: The drone can pick up a person if they are in the same location, provided the drone is free.</li>
<li><strong>Drop-off</strong>: The drone can drop off a person at a safe zone, provided the zone has capacity.</li>

<h3 id="dynamic-domain-file-overview-rescue-drone-dynamicdomainpddl">Dynamic Domain File Overview: <code>rescue-drone-dynamic_domain.pddl</code></h3>
<p>This file extends the static domain with the action <code>Increase-Capacity</code>, allowing the drone to reset the predicate <code>Safe-zone-has-capacity</code>
This assumes that randomly in any moment a person can leave the safe zone and leave a free spot in it</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Objects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>16 locations are defined in the 4x4 grid: <code>loc-1-1</code>, <code>loc-1-2</code>, <code>loc-1-3</code>, <code>loc-1-4</code>, <code>loc-2-1</code>, <code>loc-2-2</code>, <code>loc-2-3</code>, <code>loc-2-4</code>, <code>loc-3-1</code>, <code>loc-3-2</code>, <code>loc-3-3</code>, <code>loc-3-4</code>, <code>loc-4-1</code>, <code>loc-4-2</code>, <code>loc-4-3</code>, <code>loc-4-4</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drone:</strong>
<ul>
<li>One drone is defined: <code>drone1</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Three persons to be rescued:</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>person1</code>, <code>person2</code>, <code>person3</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capacities for safe zones:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Three capacity objects: <code>c1</code>, <code>c2</code>, <code>c3</code>. These likely represent the capacity limits of safe zones where rescued persons will be dropped off.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grid definition through adjacency:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The grid is defined using adjacency relations between the locations in a 4x4 configuration. For example, <code>(adjacent loc-1-1 loc-1-2)</code> means that <code>loc-1-1</code> is adjacent to <code>loc-1-2</code>, and similar relations exist to define both horizontal and vertical adjacencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drone Location:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The drone starts at a specific location within the grid, though the exact initial position is not fully visible from the provided content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Person Locations:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each person (<code>person1</code>, <code>person2</code>, <code>person3</code>) is placed in different, distinct locations within the grid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Safe Zones:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The capacities defined as <code>c1</code>, <code>c2</code>, <code>c3</code> indicate safe zones where the persons need to be delivered once rescued by the drone. Each safe zone has a capacity constraint that must be considered during the mission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The goal for all the problems is to have all persons with the rescue state set to true (all of them dropped-off on the safe zone)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="analysis-of-the-results">Analysis of the results</h2>
<h3 id="delfi-planner">Delfi Planner</h3>
<p>The search strategy used in this planning task is A* (A-star) with the <strong>merge-and-shrink heuristic</strong>. The heuristic incorporates an exact <strong>bisimulation shrink strategy</strong>, which reduces the size of the state space while preserving relevant transitions. For merging, a <strong>precomputed merge tree</strong> is used, guided by the <strong>miasm_merge_and_shrink</strong> approach. This includes heuristic scoring functions like <strong>goal relevance</strong>, <strong>DFP</strong> (Diverse Frontier Projection), and <strong>total order</strong>, ensuring an efficient search. To further optimize, <strong>structural symmetries</strong> are handled through OSS, reducing redundancy, and <strong>stubborn sets simple</strong> pruning is applied to eliminate unnecessary expansions, improving search performance.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the provided plan for each scenario, several key performance parameters were analyzed, including generated nodes, expanded nodes, and total time used, as seen in Table 1. The generated nodes represent the total number of states created during the search process, while the expanded nodes refer to the subset of those states that were fully explored, with all their possible actions evaluated. These metrics, along with the total time taken by the planner, provide insight into the efficiency and complexity of the search process in each case.</p>
<p>From these results, it can be concluded that the efficiency of the planner (in terms of time) does not solely depend on the number of generated or expanded nodes. External factors, such as the complexity of the problem and the specific structure of the state space, likely contribute to the observed differences.</p>
<p>To conclude, we have to add that A* <strong>doesn't have to find always find a optimal solution</strong></p>
<p>Delfi, across all the problems, shows a relatively balanced performance in terms of generated and expanded nodes. It often generates fewer nodes compared to BWFS, which could indicate better pruning techniques. This is especially notable in the <code>5x5_solvable</code> and <code>4x4_solvable</code> problems, where it expands fewer nodes while maintaining competitive time performance.</p>
<p>In the <strong>5x5_dyn_capacity</strong> problem, Delfi requires significantly more memory, peaking at 58,348 KB, reflecting the impact of handling more complex state spaces and dynamic problem structures. However, it consistently finds plans, with optimal or near-optimal plan lengths and costs in solvable problems.</p>
<p>Key points for Delfi:</p>
<ul>
<li>More conservative in terms of node generation.</li>
<li>Maintains a balance between memory use and time.</li>
<li>Scales reasonably well, though it requires more memory in complex tasks like <code>5x5_dyn_capacity</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bwfs-planner">BWFS Planner</h3>
<p>BWFS shows an aggressive search strategy, generating significantly more nodes in the <code>5x5_dyn_capacity</code> problem (1,656 nodes generated and 1,370 nodes expanded) compared to Delfi. Despite this, its time performance remains competitive, especially in smaller problem spaces like <code>4x4_solvable</code> and <code>5x5_solvable</code>, where its search times are quicker than Delfi’s.</p>
<p>BWFS appears to trade memory and node generation for faster exploration, as seen in the larger number of expanded nodes in most problems. This results in higher total times in some complex tasks but makes BWFS better suited for problems where rapid exploration is needed, at the cost of increased resource use.</p>
<p>Key points for BWFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster search in smaller problem spaces.</li>
<li>Trades off memory and node count for time efficiency.</li>
<li>Struggles with more complex problems, as seen in <code>5x5_dyn_capacity</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>Both planners exhibit different strengths and weaknesses. Delfi generally performs better in terms of node generation and memory management, while BWFS excels in speed, particularly for smaller problems. However, BWFS’s performance tends to degrade in more complex scenarios, while Delfi maintains more consistent scaling. The choice of planner will depend on the nature of the problem, whether it's more important to minimize memory usage or prioritize faster search times.</p>

<p>In this section we will include the animation of the <strong>solvable</strong> problems found path using Delfi planner. This helps us visualize and understand the solution found better that the waterfall view that vsCode provides. With this purpose a python script has been provided to automate this process: <code>animation_generator.py</code>.
