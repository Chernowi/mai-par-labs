# Rescue drone task #
## Abstract ##
The report focuses on the design and implementation of a rescue drone planning system for navigating disaster sites using a grid-based environment. It is included a testing of the planner on various grid configurations and an analysis of the efficiency of the solutions generated, considering factors like search space, operator applicability, and performance across different test cases. The goal is to evaluate whether the planner can consistently generate effective and optimal rescue plans.
